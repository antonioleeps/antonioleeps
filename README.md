- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @antonioleeps, a doctoral researcher at Humboldt-UniversitÃ¤t zu Berlin under Dr. Torben Ott
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in behavioural modelling of decision making processes and signal processing of physiological data, particularly on photometric recording of dopamine dynamics. A side-interest is on automatic microscopic image processing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on projects using different reinforcement learning algorithm, as well as bayersian inference to model animal behaviour in decision making.
